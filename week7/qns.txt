Write programs for the following

1. Implement Bubble sort on an array of 'n' integers. (Descending order) n - user input (1.5 mark)

2. Implement Selection sort on an array of 'n' integers. (Descending order) n - user input (1.5 mark)

3. Read an array of 'n' integers. Sort it in ascending order. (You may use any of the two methods discussed above). Perform Binary Search on the sorted array. (2 mark)

4. Given an input integer, display its binary equivalent. (1.5 mark)

5. Given a binary number, display its decimal equivalent. (1.5 mark)

2D Arrays

Note: All inputs are from the user. Assume matrix size - m*n. In case of two matrices assume sizes are m1*n1 and m2*n2. m, n, m1, m2, n1, n2 all are user inputs.

6. Read a matrix of real numbers and display them. (1 mark)

7. Read a matrix of integers and print its transpose. (1 mark)

8. Read two matrices A and B. Display the sum of the two matrices. (1 mark)

9. Read a matrix A of integers. Set every element to zero except the diagonal elements. Print the output. (1 mark)

10. Read two matrices A and B of integers. Print the product of the matrices. (2 mark)

11. Read a 3*3 matrix. Find it’s determinant. (1 mark)
